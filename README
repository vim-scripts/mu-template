This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=222

This is a micro-template file.
Templates should be in $VIMTEMPLATES directory.
The default is $VIM/vimfiles/template.
Template files should be named template.&ft (&ft is the filetype)
If filetype is not known, template.unknown will be read.
You shouldn't modify the script (unless you have <C-J> mapped..). All customizing is inside the templates.
You can insert 'fields' to the template. With the chars '<<' and '>>'.
Editing will be started at the first field in selectmode.
You can jump to the next field by pressing <C-J>
(sorry <C-J> is remapped in normal, insert (and visual) mode)
Expression evaluation:
Use the ¡ (press <m-!>) symbol to surround your expression.
Eg.: Creation date: ¡strftime('%c')¡ 
The template set is very limited, but you will get the idea, I hope.
(At least I hope you can learn some programming tricks)
FEEDBACK PLEASE!
